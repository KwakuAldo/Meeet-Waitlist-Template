Focus on responsiveness and positioning
This was particularly challenging for me because I've been struggling to get the concept of responsive web development and how to make pages responsive. I started by coding only the text and making it responsive, before adding the images. It was challenging get the positioning right and responsive, resulting in about 318 lines of CSS. It's a start, I'm proud of the results, and I know I can only get better from here on.
